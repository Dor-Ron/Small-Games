SAT-Word-Challenge
==================

In this game, you select a box from the x-y coordinate plain in a battle-ship like manner.
Under each box is a different word. You'll be asked to guess its definition from a few choices.
You have up to 3 incorrect choices. Each correct guess earns you +10 points. The objective of the game
is to beat your previous score. And obviously to provide a funner way to  study for the SAT. 
Have fun and good luck :D
